# Project1
Project1 submission for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.

Project1 is the Popular Movies - Stage 1 app.  The app displays a list of the most popular movies currently appearing on the https://www.themoviedb.org/ web site.  You can scroll through a grid showing a list of the movie posters and you can click on a poster to see detailed information about the move. 

In order to use the app, you will need to obtain a key from the website, and add it to your gradle.properties file, as described here https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html.
